# TurnFlow Home Build Log

Keep this log tight: what changed, why it changed, validation, and what remains.

## 2026-08-06 - Lint Blocker Cleared

Scope: React hook lint cleanup for the request detail workflow.

### Changed

- Removed the prop-to-state sync effect from `QuoteWorkspace`.
- Derived the displayed quote list from props plus locally hidden deleted quote IDs.
- Extracted the request cost form into a keyed `CostEditor` child so refreshed
  server cost values remount the form instead of syncing state in an effect.

### Why

Next/React lint now flags synchronous `setState` calls inside effects. The old
pattern worked functionally, but it blocked a clean pre-deploy checklist.

### Validation

- `npm.cmd run lint` passed.
- `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `npm.cmd test` passed: 33 tests.

## 2026-08-06 - Production Audit Cleared

Scope: dependency audit hardening for deploy readiness.

### Changed

- Updated `next` from `16.2.12` to `16.3.0`.
- Updated `eslint-config-next` from `16.2.12` to `16.3.0` to keep lint config
  aligned with the framework version.

### Why

`npm audit --omit=dev` reported high-severity production findings through
Next's transitive `postcss` and `sharp` dependencies. The audited fix path was
the Next `16.3.0` release line.

### Validation

- `npm.cmd audit --omit=dev --cache .npm-cache` passed: 0 vulnerabilities.
- `npm.cmd run lint` passed.
- `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `npm.cmd test` passed: 33 tests.
- `npx.cmd drizzle-kit --version` passed.

### Follow-Up

- Full `npm audit` still reports 4 moderate dev-only findings through
  `drizzle-kit -> @esbuild-kit/esm-loader -> @esbuild-kit/core-utils ->
  esbuild@0.18.20`.
- `drizzle-kit@0.31.10` is currently the latest published version, and npm's
  suggested forced fix would downgrade to `drizzle-kit@0.18.1`, so this remains
  documented rather than forced.

## 2026-08-06 - Baseline Migration Added

Scope: replace direct schema push setup with committed Drizzle migrations.

### Changed

- Added the initial generated migration in `drizzle/0000_living_rhino.sql`.
- Committed Drizzle migration metadata under `drizzle/meta/`.
- Updated `drizzle.config.ts` so `db:generate` can run without a live
  `DATABASE_URL`, while `db:migrate` and `db:push` still require one.
- Updated the README and deployment runbook to use `npm run db:migrate` for
  fresh database setup.

### Why

`db:push` was fine for the earliest POC, but a public-safe beta needs a
reviewable, repeatable schema history that can be applied consistently across
local, staging, and deployed databases.

### Validation

- `npm.cmd run db:generate` passed and produced the baseline migration.
- `npm.cmd run db:migrate` without `.env.local` failed fast with the expected
  missing `DATABASE_URL` error.
- `npm.cmd run db:push` without `.env.local` failed fast with the expected
  missing `DATABASE_URL` error.

### Follow-Up

- Run `npm run db:migrate`, `npm run db:seed`, and `npm run db:seed:demo`
  against a real Neon database once `.env.local` is available.

## 2026-08-04 - Trust Boundary Hardening

Commit: `31267e3`  
Scope: server-side guardrails for maintenance workflows.

### Changed

- Added server-side request status validation in `updateRequestStatusAction`.
- Re-checked completion proof server-side before allowing `Complete`.
- Required a non-empty waiver reason when completion proof is missing.
- Scoped reminder deletion to the verified property.
- Validated vault document `requestId` against the same owner and property.

### Why

The client UI already prompted for completion proof and routed users through the
right workflow, but SaaS guardrails need to live on the server. These changes
reduce the risk of invalid status values, bypassed completion proof,
cross-property reminder deletion, and mismatched vault document links.

### Validation

- `npm.cmd test` passed: 33 tests.
- `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint` ran and surfaced pre-existing React hook lint issues in
  `components/QuoteWorkspace.tsx` and `components/RequestDetailView.tsx`.

### Follow-Up

- Fix existing hook lint issues.
- Review npm audit findings before public beta.
- Add deploy runbook and make demo setup repeatable.

## 2026-08-04 - POC Deployment Documentation

Scope: make the hosted demo path repeatable.

### Changed

- Added `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` with environment variables, setup, seeded demo
  accounts, pre-deploy checks, and smoke-test steps.
- Added `docs/BUILD_LOG.md` as the running project build log.
- Added `db:seed:demo` as a script alias for the existing demo seed.
- Linked deployment docs and build log from the README.

### Why

The app is moving from portfolio MVP toward hosted SaaS POC. Repeatable docs
keep the project understandable when returning to it after each build step.

### Validation

- `npm.cmd test` passed: 33 tests.
- `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint` ran and still reports the known React hook lint issues in
  `components/QuoteWorkspace.tsx` and `components/RequestDetailView.tsx`.
- `npm.cmd install` reported 7 npm audit findings.

### Follow-Up

- Fix lint issues so the pre-deploy checklist can go fully green.
- Convert `db:push` POC setup to committed migrations before broader beta.
